"""Tests for the startup cache warm split into per-realm subtasks.

`startup_warm_caches_task` used to run `startup_warm_all_caches` inline: three
realms x four warmers, twelve serial operations under one 540s soft limit.
Measured on prod 2026-08-26: **4 dispatches over the retained 7-day journal, 4
SoftTimeLimitExceeded, zero completions.** The best run reached `eu`'s first
warmer 13s before it was killed; `na` -- the default realm -- was never warmed
once. The 2026-08-26 run broke down as asia hot-entity 268s + bulk 5s +
distributions 58s, then killed 209s into asia's correlations.

Same defect and same fix as `warm_realm_top_ships_task` on 2026-08-12: the
orchestrator computes nothing and dispatches instead, so each warmer gets its
own budget and one slow warmer costs one warmer rather than every warmer behind
it. The four per-realm tasks already existed on the `background` queue with
their own locks; the inline path called the bare `warm_*` functions and so
bypassed those locks entirely, letting a startup warm run on top of a Beat warm
of the same realm.
